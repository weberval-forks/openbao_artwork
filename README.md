# OpenBao artwork

In this repository we provide artwork for the OpenBao project in standardized formats.

Please have a look on the [branding documentation](https://openbao.org/docs/policies/brand/).

![Color Logo](./color/openbao-color.png)

## Toolchain

[Inkskape](https://inkscape.org/) was used to create the common source file (`src/openbao-logo-source.svg`).
It includes all variants of the colored version.
If you have to perform any modifications, please use this file.

All other `*.svg`s in this repository are simplified versions of the source or legacy.
Please keep that in mind when woking with the files.
